# Something
Hi! I'm a random Python programmer that likes turtles!<br>
I'm still learning and hope some day i'll start learning memory management and Assembly, but i probably won't lol<br>
Making some things:
* Terminal browser with it's own markup language
* Programming language called Turtle
* My own version of LOGO
